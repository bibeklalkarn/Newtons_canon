# Newtons_canon.py
This is a python program which plots the trajectory of a projectile launched from the North pole. It takes the values of initial velocity and angle of launch from the user. It uses Matplotlib, a python library, to plot the trajectory of the projectile. It is a fun way to learn about projectile trajectories. It could demonstrate all the possible trajectories of the projectile from general missile launch to hyperbolic trajectories of escape velocity projectiles.

The code is in The_main_stuff.py file.

# Using the code
-	Download the code, unzip it, and run it on any python IDE.

-	You can use google colaboratory(https://colab.research.google.com/) to run either on mobile or browser if you do not have any python IDE installed on your devices.

 	-	Copy and paste the code in one cell in the Google Colab and run it.

-	It will ask the user for the initial launch velocity and the launch angle.

-	It will print out the landing range, landing latitude and the plot the trajectory of the projectile.
