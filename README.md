# newtons_canon.py
This is a python program which plots the trajectory of a projectile launched from the North pole. It takes the values of initial velocity and angle of launch from the user. It uses Matplotlib, a python library, to plot the trajectory of the projectile. It is a fun way to learn about projectile trajectories. It could demonstrate all the possible trajectories of the projectile from general missile launch to hyperbolic trajectories of escape velocity projectiles.

The code is in main.py file.

# Using the code
Download the code, unzip it, and run it on any python IDE.

It will ask the user for the initial launch velocity and the launch angle.

It will print out the landing range, landing latitude and the plot the trajectory of the projectile.
